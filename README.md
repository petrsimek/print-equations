# print-equations

The tool for generating and printing mathematical equations for the first grade of elementary school.

## About

The simple tool to generate list of mathematical equations using proper @media print styles to let user print
the generated results via the standard browser print dialog.
### Parameters
#### Number of equations
Total number of equations being generated 
#### Minimal result
Minimal value of addender/minuend or equation result 
#### Maximal result
Minimal value of addender/minuend or equation result 
#### Evaluation limit
The value of addender/minuend used as evaluation limit to assign equation to easy or complex groups. The equations are
taken into result set by the specified scatter.

## Demo
